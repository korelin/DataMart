# DataMart

## How to run
The project is published in github:
https://github.com/korelin/DataMart

To run make sure that **run_build.sh** is runnable file (chmod +x run_build.sh) and run it.
This prompts you to enter path to data on your local computer. First it builds docker image from docker file (this may take some time).
Second it would run docker container based on previously built image.
